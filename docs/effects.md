# Effects reference

When the headless engine needs the platform to do something, it emits an effect. The platform matches on the `type` field, runs the appropriate I/O, and calls `completeEffect` with the result.

All types are defined in `src/runtime/effects.rs` (`EffectKind`). The string values below are what appears in the `type` field on the wire.

## Effect envelope

```json
{
  "id": "fx-7",
  "type": "fetchAddonResource",
  "generation": 4,
  "payload": { ... }
}
```

`id` is echoed back verbatim in `completeEffect`. `generation` is for staleness detection — the platform can discard completions whose generation is lower than the current engine generation.

## Effect types

| `enqueueOfflineDownload` | Add an item to the offline download queue |

## completeEffect result shapes

Result payloads are effect-specific. The general pattern:

```json
{
  "effectId": "fx-7",
  "result": {
    "ok": true,
    "data": { ... }
  }
}
```

For network fetches, `data` typically contains the raw response body or a parsed object. For storage reads, it contains the stored value or `null` if nothing was saved. For write operations, `result` can be `{}` on success.

The exact shape for each effect type is consumed by the engine's `completeEffect` handler in `src/headless_engine/` — check the relevant submodule (e.g. `home.rs`, `detail.rs`, `player.rs`) for the `EffectResultInput` variant that handles it.
